# Image Capture Using OpenCV in Java

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to **capture, process, and store images** using OpenCV in Java. OpenCV is a widely-used computer vision library that enables developers to interface with cameras, manipulate images, and perform various processing techniques efficiently.

## Objectives
1. **Capture Images from Camera:** Integrate OpenCV with Java to capture frames from a webcam or an external camera in real-time.
2. **Process and Analyze Images:** Apply image processing techniques such as grayscale conversion, edge detection, and filtering to enhance or analyze captured images.
3. **Store or Stream Captured Data:** Save images to disk, transmit frames over a network, or integrate the captured data into applications for further use.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- OpenCV library
- Eclipse or IntelliJ (optional, for development)
- A webcam or external camera device

## Setup Instructions
1. Download and install OpenCV.
2. Add the OpenCV JAR file and native libraries to your Java project.
3. Configure dependencies and import OpenCV in your Java classes.

## Usage
Run the application to start capturing images from your camera. You can modify the code to apply different image processing techniques or save the images to disk.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement face detection and object recognition.
- Stream captured frames in real-time over a network.
- Optimize performance using multi-threading.
